                                    <div class="img-box1 alt"><img src="images/4page-img.jpg" alt="" />Like many people over the holidays, I spent some time – maybe too much – playing one of the most popular and best reviewed video games of 2018: “Spider-Man.” While I thought
                                        I’d be taking a break from chemistry research, I found myself web-swinging through virtual research missions all over New York City. I collected samples of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Hell’s Kitchen, studied
                                        vehicle emissions in Chinatown and determined the chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter in Midtown.

                                    <p class="p1">To better understand the scientific technique that players simulate in “Spider-Man,” it helps to have a short primer on what absorption spectroscopy is. The interaction of light with matter is the most powerful means
                                        scientists have to understand what matter is made of. When matter does not interact with light, we are quite literally left in the dark. This problem is made obvious in the still unknown composition of dark matter
                                        that constitutes the vast majority of matter in the universe. </p>
                                    <p class="p1">Using light to study ordinary matter like atoms and molecules is a broad field of science known as spectroscopy. It is an important part of university courses in chemistry and physics. There are currently many different
                                        types of spectroscopy. However, the underlying concepts are almost entirely the same as the original version that began in the 17th century when Isaac Newton first dispersed sunlight with a prism.</p>
                                    <p>So what causes this phenomenon? Atoms and molecules have a set of energy levels that depend on how their electrons are arranged. The absorption of light – which remember is energy – can cause the electrons to rearrange
                                        into these different levels. The catch is that the energy – or wavelength – of light must exactly match the energy difference between two electron arrangements in an atom or molecule for absorption to occur. This
                                        set of energies is unique for each chemical and leads to a distinct absorption spectrum much like a fingerprint from which it can be identified. </p>
